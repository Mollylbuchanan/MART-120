            <h3>Inscription in an Alley</h3>
            <p>A single note blooms and dies away much like our breathing. The fact that it's always changing, often imperceptibly is what allows us to humanize the sound. Compare this to the bleeping from a printer or a car. We don't as readily empathize with it. </p>
            <p>This is how I am thinking of piano sounds today. The first words that spring to mind are shattered glass. The points of sound arise and decay in lines and clusters.</p>
            <p>There is an album by Sophie Hutchings, called "Fragments of Light," which I view to mean that the sound of a piano is like flecks of light, spinning with energy and disappearing nearly as quickly. I wonder what draws me to it? The fleeting moments that make up a life? The invisibility of our inner selves? I might have been drawn to the prospect of illuminating the invisible, because once I can see, I am more likely to act.</p>
            <p>We are equally bubbling with words unsaid. At least, I often am, as I sit in long pauses- a person who hesitates. </p>
